Despite this, many people are missing out on the benefits of cancer screening. Although many factors influence screening uptake, understanding the benefits and options for screening and knowing how to access it are critical. <span class="bold">The public and healthcare providers alike need to have accurate, digestible, and actionable information about cancer screening.</span></p>

                    <p>Communications campaigns and education have increased awareness of cancer screening, particularly for more established screening tests for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening. However, lack of knowledge and misconceptions about screening have been reported among many populations with low rates of cancer screening, including racial/ethnic minority groups, individuals with low income or low educational achievement, and populations with low access to healthcare (e.g., living in rural/remote areas, lacking health insurance).<span class="refLink"><a href="#ref2" class="refLink">2</a>-<a href="#ref4" class="refLink">4</a></span></p>
                    <p>A renewed commitment to effective large- and small-scale targeted communications about cancer screening is needed to ensure that screening reaches all populations. <span class="bold">Communications about cancer screening should be developed and disseminated in ways that empower people to apply information to make decisions about their health and increase the likelihood they will adopt proven interventions.</span> Use of a four-part health literacy framework has been suggested to guide health communications about screening <span class="nowrap">(<a href="#figure3">Figure 3</a>).<span class="refLink"><a href="#ref5" class="refLink">5</a></span></span></p>

                        <li><span class="bold italic">Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is a highly effective option for cervical cancer screening.</span> The annual Pap test has been the mainstay of cervical cancer screening for more than 50 years; however, guidelines have evolved over the past few decades. Women now have the option to be screened via Pap test or using the more sensitive HPV test, either alone or in combination with the Pap test. Screening intervals have been extended to 3 years for Pap tests and 5 years for HPV testing with or without a Pap test. Inadequate adherence to current guidelines has been documented, in part due to the mistaken belief that HPV testing is less effective than the Pap test.<span class="refLink"><a href="#ref13" class="refLink">13</a></span> </li>
                        <li><span class="bold italic">Cervical cancer screening should continue through age 65 and sometimes beyond.</span> Major guidelines recommend that cervical cancer screening begin at 21 or 25 years of age (depending on the guideline) and continue through age 65. However, compared with younger women, fewer women between 51 and 65 years of age are up to date for cervical cancer screening.<span class="refLink"><a href="#ref14" class="refLink">14</a></span> Screening also may be indicated for women older than 65 if they have not been adequately screened or if they have been recently treated for a precancerous lesion.</li>

                        <li><span class="bold italic">There are multiple effective options for colorectal cancer screening, including noninvasive stool-based tests.</span> Major guidelines recommend either direct visualization tests (e.g., colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy, virtual colonoscopy) or stool-based tests (e.g., fecal immunochemical test [FIT], FIT-DNA) for colorectal cancer screening. Nearly 90 percent of colorectal screening in the United States is being completed through colonoscopy,<span class="refLink"><a href="#ref15" class="refLink">15</a>,<a href="#ref16" class="refLink">16</a></span> likely because many providers believe colonoscopy is the best colorectal cancer screening modality.<span class="refLink"><a href="#ref17" class="refLink">17</a>,<a href="#ref18" class="refLink">18</a></span> While colonoscopy is an excellent option for colorectal cancer screening, stool-based tests offer some logistical benefits over colonoscopy, and there is no evidence they are less effective than colonoscopy for people at average risk. Survey data show that many people would select a stool-based test over colonoscopy if given the choice,<span class="refLink"><a href="#ref19" class="refLink">19</a></span> and offering stool-based tests can increase rates of colorectal cancer screening.<span class="refLink"><a href="#ref20" class="refLink">20</a></span></li>

Colorectal cancer screening should begin at age 45 for average-risk individuals.</span> Incidence rates of colorectal cancer in individuals aged 65 and older have been falling since the 1990s, largely due to increased screening. However, rates of colorectal cancer have been increasing among younger adults, including those younger than 50 years of age.<span class="refLink"><a href="#ref21" class="refLink">21</a></span> It is projected that colorectal cancer will become the leading cancer-related cause of death for those 20 to 49 years old in the United States by 2030.<span class="refLink"><a href="#ref22" class="refLink">22</a></span> This trend has led guideline makers, most recently the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF),<span class="refLink"><a href="#ref23" class="refLink">23</a></span> to recommend that colorectal cancer screening begin at age 45 rather than age 50. </li>

Lack of public awareness and lack of provider familiarity with guidelines have been identified as key barriers to lung cancer screening.<span class="refLink"><a href="#ref26" class="refLink">26</a></span> In addition, many people hold fatalistic beliefs about lung cancer, viewing the disease as untreatable.<span class="refLink"><a href="#ref27" class="refLink">27</a></span> Thus, communications campaigns should focus on increasing familiarity with lung cancer screening and its potential to reduce mortality.</li>
                        <li><span class="bold italic">Lung cancer screening can benefit current and former smokers.</span> Lung cancer screening currently is recommended for adults aged 50 to 80 years based on smoking history (e.g., at least a 20-pack-year history of smoking). The stigma surrounding smoking and lung cancer may hinder some eligible people from pursuing lung cancer screening. Communications campaigns with targeted empathic messages may help overcome this stigma. Messages and decision aids tailored based on current smoking status also may resonate better with people eligible for lung cancer screening.<span class="refLink"><a href="#ref28" class="refLink">28</a></span> </li>

Healthcare systems should conduct both large- and small-scale information campaigns tailored to the populations they serve. Regional and local advocacy organizations also can play very important roles in ensuring that messages are accessible, appropriate, and actionable for the people in their communities.

                        <p>Healthcare providers play a critical role in people’s decisions to be screened for cancer. However, guidelines frequently are updated based on new evidence and evaluation, which makes it challenging for providers to stay up to date on all guidelines relevant to their practice. Communications campaigns targeted to various types of providers are needed to ensure that current guidelines are disseminated, understood, and adopted. These campaigns should be carried out by professional societies, public health organizations, and healthcare systems. Education and training in key areas also will help providers assess cancer risk and appropriately promote screening for their patients (see <a href="Part2Goal3.html#etht" class="italic">Education and Training for Healthcare Teams</a> in Goal&nbsp;3). </p>

                    <p><span class="bold">The most effective way to improve cancer screening in the United States is through coordinated national efforts that involve all stakeholders.</span> The National Roundtable model provides mechanisms to accomplish this. The first cancer roundtable—the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable (NCCRT)—was cofounded by ACS and CDC in 1997 with the primary goal of increasing colorectal cancer screening rates among eligible U.S. adults. A key feature of NCCRT then and now is the involvement of organizations and individuals from numerous sectors that work together to address barriers to screening. A notable achievement of NCCRT is the <span class="italic">80% by 2018</span> initiative launched in 2014 to activate organizations to invest in colorectal cancer screening. More than 1,800 organizations participated in the initiative; more than 350 organizations reported reaching the 80 percent goal, and hundreds of others reported increased colorectal cancer screening rates. National colorectal cancer screening rates increased from about 65 percent to nearly 70 percent over the course of the campaign. To build on the momentum created by <span class="italic">80% by 2018</span>, NCCRT has launched <span class="italic">80% in Every Community</span> to address disparities in cancer screening and follow-up care in racial/ethnic minority, low-income, and rural communities.<span class="refLink"><a href="#ref29" class="refLink">29</a>-<a href="#ref31" class="refLink">31</a></span></p>
                    <p>Based on the success of NCCRT, ACS partnered with many organizations and companies to form roundtables for HPV vaccination, patient navigation, and lung cancer (<a href="#table2">Table 2</a>). The National Lung Cancer Roundtable (NLCRT) addresses various aspects of lung cancer screening, including shared decision-making, implementation of screening programs, access to high-quality screening, and delivery of tobacco cessation treatment in the context of lung cancer screening. NLCRT has issued proposed quality metrics for lung cancer screening programs<span class="refLink"><a href="#ref32" class="refLink">32</a></span> and a call for improved electronic health record (EHR) tools to support screening programs.<span class="refLink"><a href="#ref33" class="refLink">33</a></span></p>

                    <p>The Panel believes that the National Roundtable model provides an ideal framework for bringing stakeholders together and addressing gaps in cancer screening and follow-up care after an abnormal screening test result, including inequities experienced by various sociodemographic groups. Roundtables are well positioned to identify and amplify high-priority messages about cancer screening to providers and the public using modern communications platforms. ACS, CDC, and other key partners should invest resources to expand the National Roundtable model to increase coordination and promotion of high-quality cancer screening. <span class="embeddedRec embedded1Rec">New roundtables that include a strong focus on screening should be created for breast cancer and cervical cancer. Financial support for the NCCRT and NLCRT should be increased to allow important work on colorectal and lung cancer screening to continue and expand their reach to communities with low rates of screening and follow-up care.</span> The roundtable for cervical cancer should coordinate with the National HPV Vaccination Roundtable given their overlapping interest in cervical cancer prevention.</p>
                    <p><span class="embeddedRec embedded1Rec">National Roundtables should make health equity and alignment of messaging about cancer screening and cancer screening guidelines high priorities.</span> Roundtable membership should represent the geographic, socioeconomic, and racial/ethnic diversity of the United States to ensure that the voices and perspectives of all populations inform activities and messaging. NLCRT should implement a large-scale campaign, similar to <span class="italic">80% by 2018</span>, to raise awareness of and commitment to lung cancer screening. </p>
