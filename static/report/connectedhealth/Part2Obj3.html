                <p>Effective delivery of care across the cancer continuum is dependent on an engaged, productive workforce. Those involved in cancer care, like all health professionals, have had to adapt to massive changes in healthcare over the last several years, some of which have had a negative impact on the experience of providing care.<span class="refLink">[<a href="#ref1" class="refLink">1</a>]</span> The rollout of EHR systems, in particular, has contributed to providers’ frustration and burnout.<span class="refLink">[<a href="#ref2" class="refLink">2</a>,<a href="#ref3" class="refLink">3</a>]</span> Physician surveys have identified a number of ways in which EHRs significantly worsen professional satisfaction (see <a href="#SPDE" class="seeLink">Sources of Providers’ Dissatisfaction with EHRs</a>).<span class="refLink">[<a href="#ref4" class="refLink">4-6</a>]</span> Among respondents to a 2015 American Society of Clinical Oncology survey of oncology practices, implementation and use of EHRs was the most commonly cited practice pressure, outranking payer pressures, staffing issues, and drug pricing.<span class="refLink">[<a href="#ref7" class="refLink">7</a>]</span></p>

                <p>The transition to EHRs will not be reversed, and few physicians wish to return to paper-based medical records.<span class="refLink">[<a href="#ref4" class="refLink">4</a>]</span> However, the significant challenges that have arisen during the initial rollout of EHRs should be addressed, and more work is needed to ensure interfaces are intuitive and aligned with care teams’ workflows.<span class="refLink">[<a href="#ref3" class="refLink">3</a>]</span> Recent survey results suggest that progress is being made, as satisfaction with EHR systems has increased over the past few years among physicians in larger practices.<span class="refLink">[<a href="#ref8" class="refLink">8</a>]</span> Many members of the healthcare delivery team already enjoy some advantages of EHRs—such as remote access to patient data, electronic prescribing, integrated graphing tools that display changes in disease markers over time, and improved communication with patients and other team members.<span class="refLink">[<a href="#ref4" class="refLink">4</a>,<a href="#ref6" class="refLink">6</a>,<a href="#ref9" class="refLink">9</a>,<a href="#ref10" class="refLink">10</a>]</span> Additionally, most providers believe EHRs have potential to support improvements in both patient care and physician professional satisfaction.<span class="refLink">[<a href="#ref4" class="refLink">4</a>]</span> Improvements in interoperability, as discussed in <a href="Part2Obj1.html" class="italic">Objective 1</a>, will further increase the utility of EHRs for providers by automating data flows between laboratories and offices/hospitals. Nevertheless, additional efforts are needed to ensure that federal programs and health IT tools support the oncology workforce as it strives to deliver the best possible care.</p>

                <h2 id="AI31">Action Item 3.1: Federal incentive programs should promote use of health IT to enhance provider delivery of high-quality, patient-centered care.</h2>
                <p>Widespread adoption of EHRs since the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act was passed in 2009 largely has been spurred by the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs, sometimes referred to as the “Meaningful Use” programs.<span class="refLink">[<a href="#ref11" class="refLink">11</a>]</span> While the first stage of Meaningful Use, which focused on health IT adoption, generally is viewed as a success, providers increasingly have expressed concern about the second and third stages of the programs, citing inflexible assessment criteria, excessive documentation requirements, and focus on process-based tasks that are not directly related to—and sometimes interfere with—high-quality patient care.<span class="refLink">[<a href="#ref12" class="refLink">12-14</a>]</span> </p>
                <p>In January 2016, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) publicly agreed that federal EHR incentive programs should be modified to allow providers flexibility in their use of health IT and measure success based on the quality of patient care and outcomes. Efforts currently are under way to modify the incentive program for those who give care to Medicare beneficiaries to reflect this focus (see <a href="#MACRA" class="seeLink">Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015</a>&nbsp;).<span class="refLink">[<a href="#ref15" class="refLink">15</a>]</span> <span class="bold">The President’s Cancer Panel supports efforts to reform federal incentive programs for EHR adoption and use.

                    <p>A new Medicare EHR incentive program for clinicians currently is being developed under the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA). MACRA calls for a Merit-Based Incentive Payment System to measure eligible professionals based on quality, cost, technology use, and practice improvement rather than on the volume of services provided. Although the details of the program are still under development, the proposed rule calls for clinicians to report customizable measures that reflect how they use technology in their day-to-day practice, with a particular emphasis on interoperability and information exchange. </p>

                <p>Many provider complaints about EHRs relate to poor usability and misalignment of interfaces with clinical workflows (see <a href="#SPDE" class="seeLink">Sources of Providers’ Dissatisfaction with EHRs</a>). This may be, in part, because systems were designed to optimize billing rather than clinical care.<span class="refLink">[<a href="#ref16" class="refLink">16</a>]</span> Physicians report spending more time on clinical documentation following EHR adoption, which often results in less time for direct patient care, less patient engagement during visits, and more time spent on data entry outside of normal office hours.<span class="refLink">[<a href="#ref3" class="refLink">3</a>,<a href="#ref4" class="refLink">4</a>]</span> Poor health IT usability also can undermine data quality and contribute to medical errors, a significant problem in the U.S. healthcare system.<span class="refLink">[<a href="#ref17" class="refLink">17-19</a>]</span> In a review of extant EHR systems by the National Research Council, informatics experts reported that many of these systems failed to improve patient outcomes precisely because they failed to provide value-added support to healthcare delivery team members, patients, and their caregivers.<span class="refLink">[<a href="#ref20" class="refLink">20</a>]</span> </p>
                <p>Poor EHR usability is a significant barrier to deriving value from the sizable U.S. investment in health IT<span class="refLink">[<a href="#ref18" class="refLink">18</a>]</span> and advancing connected health for cancer. <span class="bold">EHR vendors and healthcare organizations should employ human-centered design processes during EHR development, as well as during deployment and testing phases, to ensure EHR interfaces are intuitive and aligned with providers’ workflows</span> (see <a href="#HCD" class="seeLink">Human-Centered Design</a>).

                <h2 id="AI33">Action Item 3.3: Develop and test tools and interfaces, including apps, tailored to needs of the oncology workforce.</h2>
                <p>Innovative health IT tools and interfaces, including apps, could supplement traditional EHR interfaces in a number of ways, such as integrating and displaying data in meaningful ways, providing links to outside resources and knowledge bases, guiding delivery of evidence-based care, providing decision support, and facilitating communication among healthcare delivery team members. Tools that analyze large data sets and provide actionable recommendations based on the results—perhaps using artificial intelligence or machine learning<span class="refLink">[<a href="#ref21" class="refLink">21</a>]</span>—will become more valuable, even essential, with the emergence of data-driven precision medicine (see <a href="Part1.html#PMI" class="seeLink">Precision Medicine Initiative</a> in <span class="italic">Part 1</span> and <a href="Part2Obj5.html#CM" class="seeLink">Cancer Moonshot</a> in <span class="italic">Objective 5</span>). These types of tools have potential to meet the specialized and diverse needs of the oncology workforce across the cancer continuum (<a href="Part1.html#figure2">Figure 2</a>). To date, most tools developed have been for physicians, but other healthcare professionals who care for cancer patients—nurses, advanced practice providers, pharmacists, and others—also would benefit from customized tools.</p>
                <p>Effective health IT tools can be developed by healthcare organizations and EHR vendors,<span class="refLink">[<a href="#ref22" class="refLink">22</a>]</span> but the needs of the oncology workforce will be met most effectively if the full innovative capacity of the health IT community is harnessed. To enable this, EHR vendors and healthcare organizations must permit third-party health IT developers to safely and securely access their EHR data through application programming interfaces, or APIs (see <a href="Part2Obj1.html" class="seeLink">Objective 1</a>). Developers then will be able to develop a diverse suite of apps from which providers can choose based on their needs and preferences (<a href="#figure6">Figure 6</a>). Apps can be developed and modified more quickly than traditional EHR interfaces, allowing the marketplace to keep pace with advances in medical science and be responsive to providers’ feedback. Online resources—such as the app discovery site being developed by Boston Children’s Hospital with support from ONC<span class="refLink">[<a href="#ref23" class="refLink">23</a>]</span>—can help providers find the apps and tools that best meet their needs.</p>

                    <p>Genomic data increasingly are informing treatment decisions for cancer patients and those at risk for cancer, but commercially available EHRs generally cannot display clinical genomic data in meaningful ways. The Precision Cancer Medicine (PCM) app was designed to present patients’ genomic test results to oncologists in real time as a component of clinical practice, as well as provide links to external knowledge bases that otherwise would be unavailable through the native EHR system. PCM was piloted at Vanderbilt University and integrated into that institution’s EHR system. However, because the app was developed based on an open-access API (Substitutable Medical Applications and Reusable Technology, or SMART) and uses the emerging HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources standard, it could easily be deployed for other compatible EHR systems. </p>

                    <p>Syapse, a bioinformatics company founded in 2008, has developed a software platform that helps healthcare organizations systematize precision oncology. The software integrates with organizations’ EHRs and creates a unified, longitudinal view of each patient’s clinical, pathology, radiology, treatment, and molecular data. It also provides clinical decision support, suggesting targeted therapies based on patients’ genomic data, and permits providers to compare their patients with others within their organization based on tumor type, stage, genomic variants, and other factors. The Syapse platform also includes an automated clinical trial matching tool that identifies candidate patient-trial matches based on somatic mutation profile, clinical data, demographic information, or other criteria. In response to Vice President Biden’s Cancer Moonshot, Syapse also is working with multiple partners to make aggregate clinical data available for research through the <a href="http://www.syapse.com/blog/open-press-release-june-2016/" target="_blank">Oncology Precision Network (OPeN)</a>.</p>
