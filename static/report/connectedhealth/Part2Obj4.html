						<h1 class="pageTitle">Objective 4: Facilitate health information access and sharing by ensuring adequate Internet access.</h1>

						<p>The full benefits of connected health cannot be achieved unless everyone in the United States who wants to participate and the organizations that support health and deliver healthcare have adequate access to high-speed Internet service. Access depends both on the availability of broadband service and the resources needed to obtain and maintain service.</p>

						<h2 id="AI41">Action Item 4.1: Support initiatives and programs to ensure that everyone in the United States has adequate Internet access if so desired.</h2>
						<p>
							Internet use in the United States is at a record high and continues to increase. In 2015, 84 percent of U.S. adults reported using the Internet, up from 52 percent in 2000.<span class="refLink">[<a href="#ref1" class="refLink">1</a>]</span> Internet use has increased among virtually all segments of the population, although rates continue to lag among some groups, including older adults, racial/ethnic minorities, individuals with lower incomes and lower levels of education, and those living in rural settings (<a href="#figure7">Figure 7</a>).<span class="refLink">[<a href="#ref1" class="refLink">1</a>]</span> Unfortunately, the disadvantages of lack of Internet access disproportionately affect populations that commonly experience worse health outcomes, including higher mortality rates for many cancers and/or less consistent access to high-quality cancer care.<span class="refLink">[<a href="#ref2" class="refLink">2-5</a>]</span> Connected health tools could help these at-risk populations by linking them with the people, information, and support they need to get healthy and stay well.

							<p>"Access to high-speed broadband is no longer a luxury; it is a necessity for American families, businesses, and consumers."<br />–President Barack Obama, Memorandum</p>
						</div>

						<p>
							A 2015 Pew Research Center survey found that cost was the major reason cited by most people who did not have broadband connections. About two-thirds of those who did not have a home broadband subscription indicated either the monthly service fee or the cost of a computer as a barrier to adoption.<span class="refLink">[<a href="#ref6" class="refLink">6</a>]</span> Even if they could afford it, high-speed broadband service is not available to millions of Americans in their communities. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) estimated that, as of December 2014, 10 percent of the U.S. population—approximately 34 million people—lived in places in which high-speed broadband Internet service was not available.<span class="refLink">[<a href="#ref7" class="refLink">7</a>]</span><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteLink" id="fn_1">*</a> Although Internet service is unavailable in some urban areas, rural populations are far more likely to lack adequate Internet access. More than 39 percent of Americans living in rural areas lack access to high-speed Internet compared with 4 percent of those living in urban areas. Survey data indicate that even with regular Internet access, rural residents are less likely than their urban counterparts to manage their personal health information online or email their doctors.<span class="refLink">[<a href="#ref8" class="refLink">8</a>]</span>
						</p>

						<p style="margin-bottom: 0">
							<span class="bold">The President’s Cancer Panel unequivocally supports the long-term goal of President Obama set forth in FCC’s 2010 National Broadband Plan that</span> <span class="bold italic">everyone</span> <span class="bold">in the United States should have affordable access to robust broadband service and the means and skills necessary to subscribe if they so choose.</span><span class="refLink">[<a href="#ref9" class="refLink">9</a>]</span> Given the central role of the Internet in modern society, access to the Internet should be viewed as a right, not a privilege.<span class="refLink">[<a href="#ref10" class="refLink">10</a>]</span> The Internet should be regarded as a utility. With the mandate for EHRs, access to online tools, such as patient portals, is necessary for patients to receive information from and communicate with healthcare providers. Universal Internet access could help engage medically underserved populations and overcome disparities in health and other areas.
						</p>
						<p>
							There has been encouraging progress in expanding Internet access in recent years. Since 2009, investments from the federal government have led to the deployment or upgrading of well over 100,000 miles of network infrastructure, and 45 million additional Americans have adopted broadband.<span class="refLink">[<a href="#ref11" class="refLink">11</a>]</span> Several federal agencies and public-private initiatives continue to expand broadband access by providing support for broadband planning, public access, adoption, deployment, and digital literacy (<a href="#box2">Box&nbsp;2</a>).

							<p>Sponsored Data<br /><br />Companies and organizations can partner with mobile phone carriers to make their content available free of charge to customers. When customers access the sponsored data, also called zero-rated data, it does not count toward their monthly data allotments.</p>
						</div>
						<p style="margin-top: 0">However, more work is needed to overcome the barriers to broadband access that persist for many. Federal agencies, Internet service providers, other private-sector entrepreneurs, and nonprofit organizations should continue to facilitate access to broadband Internet services at speeds adequate to support individuals’ participation in connected health. Sponsored data can make it easier for individuals with limited data plans—including many from medically underserved populations—to access high-quality health information and personal health data online (see <a href="#SD" class="seeLink">Sponsored Data</a>). However, even if the barriers of access and availability are overcome, it is critical that navigation and content are provided in a manner consistent with the culture, language, and communication skills of potential users.</p>

						<h2 id="AI42">Action Item 4.2: Support initiatives and programs to ensure adequate Internet access for all healthcare providers and organizations.</h2>
						<p>
							Healthcare providers and systems must have robust broadband access to optimize connectivity to each other and to the individuals and communities they serve. The need for high-speed broadband will only grow as telemedicine gains traction and increasing quantities of health-related data—including large imaging, pathology, and genomic data files—are collected and shared. Broadband connectivity is particularly challenging for healthcare organizations in rural settings, posing barriers to wider use of telemedicine in these communities. There often are limited broadband options in rural settings, and those available may be prohibitively expensive. An analysis by the FCC found that Dedicated Internet Access options, which guarantee access to the bandwidth needed for larger healthcare organizations, are as much as three times more expensive in rural areas than in urban areas.<span class="refLink">[<a href="#ref9" class="refLink">9</a>]</span> Furthermore, high-speed mass-market broadband options, which FCC estimates could meet the needs of offices with four or fewer clinicians, are not even available in some rural areas.<span class="refLink">[<a href="#ref9" class="refLink">9</a>]</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							Subsidies for broadband access for public and nonprofit rural healthcare providers are available through FCC’s Rural Health Care Program,<span class="refLink">[<a href="#ref12" class="refLink">12</a>]</span> and some support also is available through other federal programs and initiatives.<span class="refLink">[<a href="#ref13" class="refLink">13</a>]</span> This support should continue. <span class="bold">In addition, federal, state, local, and private-sector stakeholders should work together to ensure that all healthcare providers and organizations have access to the Internet at speeds that allow them to communicate and exchange data with other institutions and patients.</span>
