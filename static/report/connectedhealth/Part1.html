                <h2 class="red">President’s Cancer Panel Focus on Connected Health</h2>

                <p>The President’s Cancer Panel held a series of workshops across the United States in 2014&ndash;2015 to explore the role and potential of connected health in cancer prevention, care, and research in the United States. Cancer is the second most common cause of death in the United States, exceeded only by heart disease. More than 1.6 million people in the United States are diagnosed with cancer each year. As of 2014, nearly 14.5 million people in the United States were living with a personal history of cancer.<span class="refLink">[<a href="#ref8" class="refLink">8</a>]</span> Although cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment have improved over the past several decades,<span class="refLink">[<a href="#ref9" class="refLink">9</a>,<a href="#ref10" class="refLink">10</a>]</span> cancer care delivery will face significant challenges in coming years as the U.S. population ages, the oncology workforce shrinks, the costs of cancer care continue to grow, and medical advances expand treatment options.<span class="refLink">[<a href="#ref11" class="refLink">11</a>,<a href="#ref12" class="refLink">12</a>]</span> Technology-based solutions have been proposed to address challenges in cancer and many other areas of healthcare. The potential benefits of connected health are particularly pronounced for cancer for several reasons.</p>

                <ul class="bodyBullets">
                    <li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Cancer has lifelong implications.</span> Cancer diagnoses are life-changing for patients and often impose significant burdens on families and caregivers. Patients may struggle to understand their diagnoses and test results, including genomic testing results. They likely will interact with numerous providers and often must manage vast quantities of personal health information. They make decisions about treatment options and, in many cases, lack full access to the information needed to make informed choices. They also may have questions about participating in clinical trials. Challenges persist when patients transition out of active treatment. Some are faced with decisions about end-of-life care, while others cope with increased monitoring and may deal with long-term and late effects of their diseases and treatments for the rest of their lives. All of this may be compounded by financial strains due, in part, to the burden of cancer treatment. Cancer patients and their families and caregivers need varying types and levels of support throughout the different phases of treatment, from the time of diagnosis through survivorship and/or end of life. Healthy individuals also would benefit from information and resources that could help them reduce their cancer risk and increase the likelihood of early diagnosis through screening. Connected health could help individuals across the cancer continuum access and use information and resources, as well as better manage their health and cancer care (<a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a>). </li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Quality cancer care requires extensive coordination.</span> Cancer care frequently involves multiple interventions delivered by a variety of healthcare professionals who often are located in distinct clinical settings (see <a href="#CCC" class="seeLink">Cancer Care Coordination</a>). There also are numerous transitions in care as patients move between active treatment, survivorship care, and/or end-of-life care. Patients and their family members and caregivers are critical components of the care team and play important roles in care coordination. Frequent and extensive communication among patients, their family members and caregivers, and providers is essential to ensure patients receive evidence-based care consistent with their preferences and values. This is particularly challenging within the U.S. healthcare system, which often is fragmented and difficult to navigate. Connected health could help all stakeholders communicate and access information in timely and efficient ways, enabling delivery of higher-quality care.</li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Cancer biology is complex.</span> Cancer is a not a single disease but, rather, a set of diseases driven by myriad molecular aberrations and influenced by numerous environmental and lifestyle factors. Past research has led to development of targeted therapies for some cancer subtypes in recent years, improving outcomes for many patients. Knowledge of factors underlying development of various cancer subtypes and their responses to treatment is expected to increase even more in coming years through efforts such as the Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI)<span class="refLink">[<a href="#ref13" class="refLink">13</a>]</span> (see <a href="#PMI" class="seeLink">Precision Medicine Initiative</a>) and the Cancer Moonshot<span class="refLink">[<a href="#ref14" class="refLink">14</a>]</span> (see <a href="Part2Obj5.html#CM" class="seeLink">Cancer Moonshot</a> in <span class="italic">Objective 5</span>&nbsp;), opening the door to exciting advances in cancer prevention and treatment. Individuals and physicians will need tools to help them effectively manage and use the unprecedented volumes of data that will be available to inform personal and clinical decision making.</li>

                    <p>A study in the United Kingdom found that cancer patients met with at least 13 different doctors during the course of their cancer care. More than half of patients met with 30 or more doctors. One primary care physician recently recounted his experience when one of his patients was diagnosed with bile duct cancer. In the 80 days between the day the tumor was detected via computed tomography scan and its removal, the physician had 40 communications with 11 other providers and communicated with the patient or the patient's wife 12 times.</p>

The goal of precision medicine is to better prevent and treat diseases by taking into account individual differences in people’s genes, environments, and lifestyles. As part of PMI, the National Institutes of Health is creating a voluntary national research cohort of at least 1 million people from diverse backgrounds. Although PMI will yield insights in a number of areas, cancer is a high priority. As part of PMI, the National Cancer Institute is expanding its investment in precision oncology with the goal of using genomics to identify and target molecular vulnerabilities of individual cancers. </p>

                <p>The Panel learned about many exciting and promising applications of technology in health and healthcare, and examples are described throughout this report.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteLink" id="fn_1">*</a>  However, patients and providers who use these technologies often report significant challenges and frustrations. Patients say they frequently identify errors in their medical records and have difficulties getting these errors corrected. Physicians report that EHRs disrupt their workflows and that they spend hours each week, often outside the office, entering data. Many patients and physicians feel that technology interferes with the personal interactions that are so critical to patient-centered care. Current technologies do not yet support free exchange of health information—EHR systems at different organizations, even those created by the same vendor, often are not interoperable.<span class="refLink">[<a href="#ref15" class="refLink">15-18</a>]</span> Thus, healthcare information often still is shared via fax or in paper form by patients themselves, even when the data are in digital form. Furthermore, technical barriers and inadequate models for patient consent have precluded large data sets stored in EHRs from being used for surveillance or large-scale research activities. These barriers to effective implementation of technology in healthcare are significant threats to quality cancer care.</p>

                <p><span class="bold">The Panel concluded that although connected health for cancer has not yet been achieved, technology has significant potential to help accomplish the following critical goals: improve the experience of care for cancer patients and their caregivers, improve the experience of the oncology workforce in providing care, and reduce the burden of cancer at the population level (<a href="#figure3">Figure 3</a>).</span> To accomplish these goals, technologies must be developed and implemented thoughtfully and then continually improved based on users’ experiences and evidence. Cross-sector collaborations among those in the healthcare, biomedical research, and technology fields will be essential. The Panel has identified several principles that should guide efforts to expand and improve applications of technology in cancer to advance connected health in ways that truly support efficient and effective collection, flow, and use of information (see <a href="#PCH" class="seeLink">Principles of Connected Health</a>).</p>

At the center of the circle is “connected health.” Surrounding connected health is a ring with the terms surveillance, risk reduction, cancer care, and research. This illustrates that connected health enables these activities. The outer ring of the circle is made up of three segments representing cancer-related goals: (1) improved care experience for patients and caregivers, (2) increased oncology workforce satisfaction in providing care, and (3) reduced cancer burden at population level." title="Figure 3.
