In this workshop, first in a series on connected health and cancer, the President's Cancer Panel and leaders in technology, government, advocacy, and healthcare will explore connected health's potential to revolutionize the way individuals manage their health and chronic diseases, including cancer, to achieve optimal well-being. Presentations will feature trends in technology, patient behavior, healthcare, and policy that are driving changes in patients' interactions with clinicians and healthcare systems. Participants will envision the future of a patient-centered healthcare system powered by enhanced connectivity and describe actions needed to achieve the goal of improved cancer-related outcomes. Questions for exploration include the following:

- Does connected health improve patients' activation, engagement, and patient-provider communication?
- What cancer-related outcomes can be achieved through connected health?
- Would connected health save dollars by using resources more effectively and efficiently?
- What are the best examples of connected health in the real world?
- What is the impact of connected health on diverse patients?
- If the use of connected health successfully advances in the next five years, what would that look like? How could a fully connected healthcare system affect prevention and treatment of cancer and other diseases?
- What aspects of that connected health future state are most important to achieve?
- What are the barriers to achieving more-widespread use of connected health technologies, and how might challenges be addressed?

This workshop is co-chaired by two national leaders in connected health. **David K. Ahern, PhD,** is Director of the Program in Behavioral Informatics and eHealth at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Special Advisor, Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, National Cancer Institute and **Bradford Hesse, PhD,** is Chief, Health Communication and Informatics Research Branch, Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, National Cancer Institute.

Presentations and moderated discussions among participants will inform the Panel's recommendations in a formal report to the President of the United States after the conclusion of series workshops.
