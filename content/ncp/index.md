The [National Cancer Plan](https://nationalcancerplan.cancer.gov/) provides a framework for collaboration to realize the Cancer Moonshot goal of reducing cancer mortality rates in the United States by at least 50% by 2047 and to end cancer as we know it. The Plan calls for a big-picture, whole-of-government approach to support cancer research, develop strategies, share knowledge, and accelerate progress against inequities in cancer care.
The President’s Cancer Panel has been charged with monitoring the National Cancer Plan by gathering information from across the cancer community about progress toward the Plan's goals and identifying opportunities for improvement.

<div class="quote-text">The Panel looks forward to hearing from federal/state agencies, industry, universities, advocacy groups, nonprofits, and individual people on their commitment to making the eight goals of the Plan a reality.</div>
