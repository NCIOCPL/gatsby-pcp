On April 3, with leadership from National Cancer Institute (NCI) Director Monica Bertagnolli, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released a [National Cancer Plan](https://nationalcancerplan.cancer.gov/) to guide the nation’s efforts against cancer. The Plan provides a framework for collaboration to reduce cancer mortality rates in the United States by at least 50% over the next 25 years and to end cancer as we know it. The Plan calls for a big-picture, whole-of-government approach to support cancer research, develop strategies, share knowledge, and accelerate progress against inequities in cancer care.

The President’s Cancer Panel has been charged with monitoring the National Cancer Plan by gathering information about progress toward the Plan's goals and identifying opportunities for improvement. To assist with this task, the Panel invites stakeholders from across the [National Cancer Program](https://prescancerpanel.cancer.gov/about/blogs/national-cancer-program/) to provide updates on their relevant programs, activities, and achievements via:

- **[Public meetings](/ncp/meetings)**.
- **Panel’s email inbox [PresCancerPanel@mail.nih.gov](mailto:PresCancerPanel@mail.nih.gov).**
- **Social Media**. Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/prescancerpanel) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/president's-cancer-panel/). Tag social media posts with *#NationalCancerPlan*, *#CancerMoonshot*, and *#Every1HasARole*.

National Cancer Program activities collected via email and the stakeholder meetings will inform the Panel's annual report to the President, which will highlight opportunities to optimize implementation of the National Cancer Plan. Some activities also may be highlighted in President’s Cancer Panel social media and blog posts and/or the National Cancer Plan Updates newsletter.
