The cancer workforce, comprising healthcare professionals and researchers at all training levels, plays a fundamental role in advancing cancer research, delivering high-quality cancer care, and improving cancer outcomes. However, across the [National Cancer Program](/about/blogs/national-cancer-program/), the workforce faces numerous challenges that may undermine the quality of cancer care and research. These challenges include staff shortages, clinician burnout, low retention rates in both academic and community settings, lack of diversity, and uneven distribution of oncology professionals across the United States. Collaborative efforts involving government, academia, and the private sector are critical to sustain and support the cancer workforce to meet the growing needs of current and future patients.

On September 12-13, the President’s Cancer Panel will host two public virtual meetings to assess workforce challenges and identify approaches to improve training, recruitment, and retention of a robust and diverse clinical care and research workforce. This topic aligns with and supports the [National Cancer Plan](https://nationalcancerplan.cancer.gov/) goal to [Optimize the Workforce](https://nationalcancerplan.cancer.gov/goals/optimize-the-workforce). These meetings will inform the Panel’s report to the President of the United States, highlighting opportunities to support the development of the next generation of clinicians, researchers, and other healthcare professionals critical to shaping the future of cancer care.
