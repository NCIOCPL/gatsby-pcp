Through public meetings, the Panel will gather information from [National Cancer Program](/about/blogs/national-cancer-program/) stakeholders on their activities to meet the [National Cancer Plan’s](https://nationalcancerplan.cancer.gov/) goals. Invited organizations will have the opportunity to share progress to date, discuss implementation challenges, and highlight key opportunities for collaboration. Activities collected will inform the Panel’s report to the President and may be highlighted on the Panel’s social channels.

The Panel enthusiastically looks forward to hearing from organizations in writing and at future meetings.
