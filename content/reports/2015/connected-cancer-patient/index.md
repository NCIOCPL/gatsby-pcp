Accumulating evidence suggests that connected health approaches could lead the way to better health outcomes; for example, by improving patient adherence to medication, facilitating access to specialty care, and reducing referral wait times, among other promising applications. Yet, it is not yet clear what a truly connected health system of the future looks like. In this integrative workshop, third in a series on connected health and cancer, the President’s Cancer Panel and invited participants will envision an interoperable health system that is integrated with—and adapted to—the real-world environments in which people live.

Participants will explore and recommend concrete actions that could accelerate the development of a patient-centered approach to cancer prevention, treatment, and survivorship in order to maximize the potential of connected health technologies. Participants will contemplate and respond to a scenario for a future connected health system by the year 2020 and consider key areas for potential intervention, including the following:

- Personal health information and data sharing
- Person- and family-centered care
- Optimal use of devices, sensors, and apps
- National health information infrastructure

This workshop is co-chaired by two national leaders in connected health. **David K. Ahern, PhD,** is Director, Program in Behavioral Informatics and eHealth, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Special Advisor, Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, National Cancer Institute. **Bradford W. Hesse, PhD,** is Chief, Health Communication and Informatics Research Branch, Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, National Cancer Institute.

Presentations and moderated discussions among participants will inform the Panel’s recommendations in a formal report to the President of the United States after the conclusion of series workshops.
