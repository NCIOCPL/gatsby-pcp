On April 3, with leadership from National Cancer Institute (NCI) Director Monica Bertagnolli, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released a National Cancer Plan to guide the nation’s efforts against cancer. As members of the President’s Cancer Panel, we are charged by the National Cancer Act of 1971 to monitor the development and execution of the activities of the National Cancer Program. We enthusiastically endorse the National Cancer Plan as a roadmap for advancing the National Cancer Program. As highlighted in the Plan, we look forward to assessing the activities undertaken both inside and outside of government to realize the vision of the reignited Cancer Moonshot: to end cancer as we know it.

Under the leadership of then-Vice President Joe Biden, the original Cancer Moonshot brought new urgency to the fight against cancer when it was launched in 2016. Last year, President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden announced new efforts to extend the Cancer Moonshot in pursuit of two critical, audacious new goals: to reduce cancer mortality by at least 50% in the next 25 years and to improve the experience of people and their families living with and surviving cancer.

The Plan calls for a big-picture, whole-of-government approach to support cancer research, develop strategies, share knowledge, and accelerate progress against cancer and inequities in cancer care. The eight goals of the National Cancer Plan are to:

- Prevent cancer
- Detect cancers early
- Develop effective treatments
- Eliminate inequities
- Deliver optimal care
- Engage every person
- Maximize data utility
- Optimize the workforce
- Each goal is accompanied by practical strategies for achieving meaningful progress.

We are especially inspired by the Plan’s final call to action: that **everyone in our society, every organization and individual, do their part to end suffering from cancer.** We accept this call to action and look forward to doing our part by monitoring and assessing progress and making recommendations to the President on the Plan's optimal implementation to ensure that the benefits reach every community and population in the United States.

The Panel applauds NCI, HHS, and the Biden Administration for creating this conscientious, comprehensive plan. We urge all public and private stakeholders to join us in supporting this vital national effort.
