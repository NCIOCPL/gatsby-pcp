The President's Cancer Panel conducts a series of meetings on a selected topic to gather input from key stakeholders. The Panel forms its recommendations, and findings are presented to the President of the United States.

**How does the Panel choose topics to examine?** \
The Panel considers issues critical to the National Cancer Program that are significant, timely, and manageable and that have potential to result in concrete, actionable recommendations. Conversations with stakeholders and partners in cancer-related organizations help to identify priority issues and potential focus areas.

**Who implements the recommendations the Panel makes in its reports?** \
The Panel is an advisory committee to the President of the United States and relies on stakeholders that have authority to implement recommendations.

**Are Panel recommendations supported by the National Cancer Institute?** \
The Panel is independent of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The Panelâ€™s conclusions and recommendations go directly to the President of the United States and should not be inferred as policy or perspectives of NCI, NIH, or HHS. NCI provides administrative support for the Panel.

**How can I get involved with cancer research advocacy efforts in the federal government?** \
Advocates interested in participating in activities at NCI that promote the collective patient perspective in research are encouraged to contact [NCI's Office of Advocacy Relations](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/oar).

**Does the Panel update past reports?** \
The Panel typically does not revisit past topics or update previous reports.
